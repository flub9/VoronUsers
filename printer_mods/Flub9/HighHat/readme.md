# HighHat for Voron 0
## HighHat is a dual filament AMS for the Voron 0.2


### HighHat is possible thanks to the work of many others including:

mjonuschat's [NightOwl](https://github.com/mjonuschat/NightOwl) - A fully self-enclosed dual filament AMS system

[Filamentalist Rewinder](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/tree/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder) - from the ERCF Community

Fysetc's [ERB 2.0 MCU](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-ERB/tree/main/V2.0) - A commercially available MCU meant for AMS systems
